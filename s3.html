Historically known as Bohemia,[14] it is bordered by Austria to the south, Germany to the west, Poland to the northeast, and Slovakia to the southeast.[15] The Czech Republic has a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,871 square kilometers (30,452 sq mi) with a mostly temperate continental and oceanic climate. The capital and largest city is Prague; other major cities and urban areas include Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Liberec.<br />
<br />
The Duchy of Bohemia was founded in the late 9th century under Great Moravia. It was formally recognized as an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire in 1002 and became a kingdom in 1198.[16][17] Following the Battle of Moh&aacute;cs in 1526, all of the Crown lands of Bohemia were gradually integrated into the Habsburg monarchy. Nearly a hundred years later, the Protestant Bohemian Revolt led to the Thirty Years&#39; War. After the Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburgs consolidated their rule. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Crown lands became part of the Austrian Empire.<br />
<br />
In the 19th century, the Czech lands became more industrialized, and in 1918 most of it became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic following the collapse of Austria-Hungary after World War I.[18] Czechoslovakia was the only country in Central and Eastern Europe to remain a parliamentary democracy during the entirety of the interwar period.[19] After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Nazi Germany systematically took control over the Czech lands.<br />
<br />
Czechoslovakia was restored in 1945 and three years later became an Eastern Bloc communist state following a coup d&#39;&eacute;tat in 1948. Attempts to liberalize the government and economy were suppressed by a Soviet-led invasion of the country during the Prague Spring in 1968. In November 1989, the Velvet Revolution ended communist rule in the country and restored democracy. On 31 December 1992, Czechoslovakia was peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.<br />
<br />
The Czech Republic is a unitary parliamentary republic and developed country with an advanced, high-income social market economy. It is a welfare state with a European social model, universal health care and free-tuition university education. It ranks 32nd in the Human Development Index. The Czech Republic is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, the OECD, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Visegr&aacute;d Group.<br />

Etymology<br />
Main article: Name of the Czech Republic<br />
The traditional English name &quot;Bohemia&quot; derives from Latin: Boiohaemum, which means &quot;home of the Boii&quot; (a Gallic tribe). The current English name ultimately comes from the Czech word Čech.[20][21][22] The name comes from the Slavic tribe (Czech: Če&scaron;i, Čechov&eacute;) and, according to legend, their leader Čech, who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on Ř&iacute;p Mountain. The etymology of the word Čech can be traced back to the Proto-Slavic root *čel-, meaning &quot;member of the people; kinsman&quot;, thus making it cognate to the Czech word člověk (a person).[23]<br />
<br />
The country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely Bohemia (Čechy) in the west, Moravia (Morava) in the east, and Czech Silesia (Slezsko; the smaller, south-eastern part of historical Silesia, most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast.[24] Known as the lands of the Bohemian Crown since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including Czech/Bohemian lands, Bohemian Crown, Czechia, [25] and the lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslaus. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, the new name of Czechoslovakia was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within one country.[26]<br />
<br />
After Czechoslovakia dissolved on the last day of 1992, Česko was adopted as the Czech short name for the new state and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic recommended Czechia for the English-language equivalent.[27] This form was not widely adopted at the time, leading to the long name Czech Republic being used in English in nearly all circumstances. The Czech government directed use of Czechia as the official English short name in 2016.[28] The short name has been listed by the United Nations[29] and is used by other organizations such as the European Union,[30] NATO,[31] the CIA,[32] Google Maps,[33] and the European Broadcasting Union.[34] In 2022, the American AP Stylebook stated in its entry on the country that &quot;Czechia, the Czech Republic. Both are acceptable. The shorter name Czechia is preferred by the Czech government. If using Czechia, clarify in the story that the country is more widely known in English as the Czech Republic.&quot;[35]<br />

Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the Paleolithic era.[citation needed]<br />
<br />
In the classical era, as a result of the 3rd century BC Celtic migrations, Bohemia became associated with the Boii.[37] The Boii founded an oppidum near the site of modern Prague.[38] Later in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the Marcomanni and Quadi settled there.[39]<br />
<br />
Slavs from the Black Sea&ndash;Carpathian region settled in the area (their migration was pushed by an invasion of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe into their area:[40] Huns, Avars, Bulgars and Magyars).[41] In the sixth century, the Huns had moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia, and some of present-day Austria and Germany.[41]<br />
<br />
During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant Samo, supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled Avars,[42] became the ruler of the first documented Slavic state in Central Europe, Samo&#39;s Empire. The principality of Great Moravia, controlled by Moymir dynasty, arose in the 8th century.[43] It reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of Svatopluk I of Moravia), holding off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a role being played by the Byzantine mission of Cyril and Methodius. They codified the Old Church Slavonic language, the first literary and liturgical language of the Slavs, and the Glagolitic script.[44]</p>
